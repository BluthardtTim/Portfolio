                <h5>Outcome of a Design Sprint</h5>
                <p>
                    As part of a university project, this project focuses on the concept
                    and design of an app that aimes to prevent food waste. The project
                    followed the structure of the Google Design Sprint. Within a week,
                    topics such as user research, prototyping, etc. were addressed,
                    ending in the creation of a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) by the end
                    of the sprint."

                <h5>What is Growceries?</h5>
                <p>
                    Growceries is a MVP, a platform where farmers can reach out to
                    customers and customers can find locally grown food. Foodwaste can
                    be reduced because farmers or any other grandma can sell their
                    harvest which is to much for their own usage. That allows customers
                    to have easier access to regional and ecological food.

                <h5>Design Process</h5>
                <p>
                    First, we interviewed potential users to gain
                    valuable insights. Speaking to our target group, local farmers and
                    environment friendly consumers helped us to understand the needs and
                    problems of both sides. We discovered that ecological and regional
                    food is important for a lot of people. To drive somwhere else just to get
                    the regional food is often to much effort. 
                    
                    So we needed a solution
                    that brings transportation to a minimum and also allows other
                    customers to drive further if they want to. Secondly, privacy is an
                    important factor. Therefore it is important to hide the exact location of a
                    selling farmer, but at the same time letting the customer know how
                    long it takes to get to the target location. Additionally the
                    customer must be informed where to go ans pick up the goods.

                <div></div>
                <p>
                    Out of these insights we framed 'How might we' questions to clearly
                    define the applications outcome. After a deep market research,
                    we proceeded with initial sketches and visualizations. The process
                    also included user testing to refine the concept. This led to the
                    development of a final Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

                <h5>Branding</h5>
                <p>
                    To create a professional look for our app, we developed
                    brand guidelines and applied them to our product. These guidelines
                    ensure an intuitive and visually appealing interface, making it easy
                    for users to navigate while maintaining consistency across the
                    application.

                <h5>Outcome of the project</h5>
                <p>
                    The result of the project is a fully functional prototype of the
                    Growceries app. The app connects local farmers with consumers,
                    allowing users to purchase fresh products directly from the farm. The
                    app also allows users to share their own
                    product with others. This helps to reduce food waste.
